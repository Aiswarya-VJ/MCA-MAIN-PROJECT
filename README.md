SIGNALING-Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse.

#ISSUE : Traditional camera-based hand gesture recognition faces accuracy issues under varying light, noise removal, image smoothing, and complex backgrounds. Using markers or gloves adds complexity and requires adjustments for different hand sizes.

#PROPOSED : Signaling consists of two modules: One which works on recognizing and functioning on hand signals by making use of MediaPipe Hand detection, and other by recognizing the voice and to function.


#FEATURES :Ten hand signal functions and eight voice recognition functions.

          :In Signal recognition, use palm detector model,hand landmark model and gesture recognition model through Mediapipe framework.
          
          :Voice recognition includes speech recognition, Location finding, Google searching using pyautogui,  pynput.keyboard and so on.
